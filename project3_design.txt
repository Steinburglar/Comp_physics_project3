Design doc:

basic idea:
make an object that is the model
    initial parameters: dimensionality/shape (could be triangle), J value, initial config (make mutable)\

    instance variables: 
            Temperature
            Pandas frame of all the lattice sites, values 1 or -1


    methods:
        get M: simply sum the lattice sites
        set initial config: might want 2 versions, start with randomized but we can try other things
            should have an exactly 50/50 starting config as well
        change temperature: changes temp instance variable
        the big one: equilibrate algorithm:
